# Python Practice Repository

Welcome to my Python practice repository! This repository showcases my knowledge and skills in Python programming. It contains various directories that cover different areas of Python development, including algorithms and data structures, data science using libraries like Pandas and NumPy, and single-file coding projects with Tkinter as the GUI framework.

## Directories

### 1. Algorithms and Data Structures

The `Algorithms_DataStructures` directory houses files containing basic Python practice related to algorithms and data structures. Here, you will find implementations of commonly used algorithms, such as sorting, searching, graph algorithms, and data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and more. Exploring this directory will demonstrate my understanding of fundamental computer science concepts.

### 2. Data Science Practice

In the `Data_Science` directory, you'll find Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks focused on data science. This section showcases my familiarity with popular data science libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and others. Here, I work with datasets, perform data manipulation and analysis, visualize data, and apply machine learning techniques. This directory demonstrates my ability to work with data and extract valuable insights.

### 3. Tkinter GUI Projects

The `TkinterProjects` directory contains single-file coding projects that utilize Tkinter as the GUI framework. Tkinter is a powerful library for creating graphical user interfaces in Python. In this section, you will find various interactive applications and utilities that I have built. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in creating intuitive and user-friendly GUI applications using Tkinter.
